## 1<sup>st</sup> blog post _(1/26/23)_ <!--used super tag and ** for italics -->



The first week was not quite what I expected, it was alot more reading that what I had originally thought. I was not expeting to encounter so many issues the first few days just trying to set up my environment for this course. But I guess encountering issues and learning how to solve them is part of learning that I have to get used to in this field.

I'm excited to learn more about css and all the tools to create a websites style. I am also looking forward to learning about javascript git/github even though I struggle with them I enjoy the challenge.

By reading this blog, you can learn about my journey of learning web developement and the obstacles I encounter and how I will overcome them. You can also get a better feel for the type of person I am.

### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

HTML is used as the layout for a webpage, CSS is used to style and postion the content on a webpage, and Javascript can be used for inteactivity to make the users experiece better. It's hard to get used to pseudocoding, but I know that it is a skill that I must develope to create structured and organised code. It was nice having someone alsways on standby to help me when I had a question. Not much hindered my progress during onboarding, maybe just not having enough time to catch up on the previose days material.

### What is Pseudocode and how does it help with programming?

- Pseudocoding is basically forming out all the logic before even opening an IDE to start programming. Its really hard for me to make myself pseudocode as I am really want to dive in and build something. But I do see through trial and error how having a layed out plan and structure beforehand can inprove efficiency and make things easier in the long run. I hope I can master this skill even more in the future coming weeks as I complete this bootcamp!

### Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?

- I think it is pretty straightforward. I have had to learn new methods and function in javascript and Frameworks and libraries just seem like more functions that I need to familiarise myself with before I use them. I'm excited to learn more about webix and how to speed up and optimise a website. I dont know much about the stats and speed of how a website loads on the client end, but learning about it and how to improve the performance of a site sounds fascinating to me and I look forward to it. I would like to learn more about the meteor framework. From what I've read it seems to include alot of tools that provide the fastest way to get a javascript app up and running and I think it would be very beneficial to learn this tool.

- I've learned that CLI's are very powerful in inreracting with my computer and the files it holds. At the moment I think using CLI's can be a little scary because of the controll it gives me and the fact I might break something within it.



- If I were to build a CLI I would want it to interact with my computer OS and complete tasks like executing files and programs.

### List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code

- Creating an interactive website would take longer without a tto like Bootstrap because of the amount of css I would need to write to adjust behavior of containers when the size is decreased.

### Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?

- THe biggest hurdle for me has just been trying to wrap my head around javascript concepts and how all these different tehnologies that we have work together. I have also struggled with deciding what to allocate my attention to when being given something new to learn

### Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?

- I have a few ideas for my final projects such as: (1.)building an amazon wesite clone, (2)building a movie website where I can look up movies and comment a review(I guess a fandago clone).

### What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript?

- What surprised me was how quickly I felt like I could just gloss over some concept because they were very similiar to Javascript. I know get that once you learn one language and the core concepts, that information transfers over to learning another language.

### What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?

- Some similarities I see are that they both have loops that act the same and datatypes that work similiarly to each other

### If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?

- I don't really know. I feel like Python is more beginner friendly in its syntax and has helped me in this week understand concepts such as datatypes and classes that I was not understanding while learning javascript. But I get why we learn javascript first because it directly ties into the frontend of web dev and with html/css. I think learning Python first would have benefitted me learning core concepts and syntax in a shorter time becasue of its syntax. But Javascript also seems to have more detailed information and learning materials available for beginners and being able to apply it to frontend concepts that we prevously learned was very engaging.

### Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future?
