 ### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
 * The first week was not quite what I expected, it was alot more reading that what I had originally thought.  I was not expeting to encounter so many issues the first few days just trying to set up my environment for this course. But I guess encountering issues and learning how to solve them is part of learning that I have to get used to in this field.
