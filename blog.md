### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

- The first week was not quite what I expected, it was alot more reading that what I had originally thought. I was not expeting to encounter so many issues the first few days just trying to set up my environment for this course. But I guess encountering issues and learning how to solve them is part of learning that I have to get used to in this field.

### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

- HTML is used as the layout for a webpage, CSS is used to style and postion the content on a webpage, and Javascript can be used for inteactivity to make the users experiece better.

### What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?

- It's hard to get used to pseudocoding, but I know that it is a skill that I must develope to create structured and organised code.

### What is Pseudocode and how does it help with programming?

- Pseudocoding is basically forming out all the logic before even opening an IDE to start programming. Its really hard for me to make myself pseudocode as I am really want to dive in and build something. But I do see through trial and error how having a layed out plan and structure beforehand can inprove efficiency and make things easier in the long run. I hope I can master this skill even more in the future coming weeks as I complete this bootcamp!

### Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?

- I think it is pretty straightforward. I have had to learn new methods and function in javascript and Frameworks and libraries just seem like more functions that I need to familiarise myself with before I use them

### What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?

- I'm excited to learn more about webix and how to speed up and optimise a website. I dont know much about the stats and speed of how a website loads on the client end, but learning about it and how to improve the performance of a site sounds fascinating to me and I look forward to it.

### Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.

- I would like to learn more about the meteor framework. From what I've read it seems to include alot of tools that provide the fastest way to get a javascript app up and running and I think it would be very beneficial to learn this tool.

### What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?

- I've learned that CLI's are very powerful in inreracting with my computer and the files it holds. At the moment I think using CLI's can be a little scary because of the controll it gives me and the fact I might break something within it.

### If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?

- If I were to build a CLI I would want it to interact with my computer OS and complete tasks like executing files and programs.

### List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code

- Creating an interactive website would take longer without a tto like Bootstrap because of the amount of css I would need to write to adjust behavior of containers when the size is decreased.

## Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?

- THe biggest hurdle for me has just been trying to wrap my head around javascript concepts and how all these different tehnologies that we have work together. I have also struggled with deciding what to allocate my attention to when being given something new to learn

## Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?

- I have a few ideas for my final projects such as: (1.)building an amazon wesite clone, (2)building a movie website where I can look up movies and comment a review(I guess a fandago clone).

## What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript?

- What surprised me was how quickly I felt like I could just gloss over some concept because they were very similiar to Javascript. I know get that once you learn one language and the core concepts, that information transfers over to learning another language.
