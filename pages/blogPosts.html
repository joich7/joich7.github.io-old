## 1<sup>st</sup> blog post *(1/26/23)*  <!--used super tag and ** for italics -->
### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
- The first week was not quite what I expected, it was alot more reading that what I had originally thought.  I was not expeting to encounter so many issues the first few days just trying to set up my environment for this course. But I guess encountering issues and learning how to solve them is part of learning that I have to get used to in this field.

## 3<sup>rd</sup> blog post *(2/10/23)*

### What is Pseudocode and how does it help with programming?
- Pseudocoding is basically forming out all the logic before even opening an IDE to start programming. Its really hard for me to make myself pseudocode as I am really want to dive in and build something. But I do see through trial and error how having a layed out plan and structure beforehand can inprove efficiency and make things easier in the long run. I hope I can master this skill even more in the future coming weeks as I complete this bootcamp!


## 4<sup>th</sup> blog post *(2/17/23)*

### Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?
- I think it is pretty straightforward. I have had to learn new methods and function in javascript and Frameworks and libraries just seem like more functions that I need to familiarise myself with before I use them 
### What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
- I'm excited to learn more about webix and how to speed up and optimise a website. I dont know much about the stats and speed of how a website loads on the client end, but learning about it and how to improve the performance of a site sounds fascinating to me and I look forward to it. 
### Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.
- I would like to learn more about the meteor framework. From what I've read it seems to include alot of tools that provide the fastest way to get a javascript app up and running and I think it would be very beneficial to learn this tool.
